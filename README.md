# Description

Your task is to write a simple interpreter that can execute a subset of Ethereum Virual Machine (EVM) operation codes. Your implementation will be checked against official Ethereum tests.

What to do:

1. You take a couple of virtual machine tests from Ethereum Common Tests from us.
2. You read [Ethereum's Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) to understand how Ethereum, EVM and related to your tests operation codes work.
3. You read description of [EVM Tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests.)
4. You implement a simple interpreter and check against tests.
5. You send your solution to us.
